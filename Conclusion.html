        <h2><span style="font-size: 18px;">In conclusion, this literature  portfolio is the symbol of my completion of this wonderful subject.<br> The journey of this subject taught me many things, I learned that literature is not just a simple story making and it has a deeper voyage in it.<br> This also widened my horizon by unlocking my inner writer and coming up with a story is really fun and creative.<br> Through the analysis and interpretation of these texts, a deeper understanding of the power of language and storytelling has emerged.<br> Each piece contributes to the mosaic of literature, reminding us of its ability to transcend time and culture, resonating with readers across generations.<br> Generations that greatly honed and molded the concept of literature across the different timelines; wars, peace, celebrations, sorrows, and independence.<br> This taught me that literature is not just a story, it is an art, a masterpiece, a form of expression where every individual has the freedom to exhibit their creative imagination.<br> 
        <br>
            Expression of an individual affected by experience.<br>  As I close this portfolio, I carry with me a renewed appreciation for the art of words and the unique ways in which literature captures the essence of our shared humanity.
